<p>This extension fetches the responses of unrequested items in the site map.</p>
<p>When browsing a target, Burp adds to the site map any items that are inferred 
from actual responses. Some of these items may never get requested, and will show up as gray in the site map.
This extension takes care of those by requesting each of them and adding its response to the site map.
No more gray nodes in Burp's site map!</p>
